    <h1>How the Internet Works 🌐</h1>
    <p>
      We all use the internet daily — opening Google, watching YouTube, or
      checking Instagram. But have you ever wondered: what really happens when
      you type a website name and press Enter?<br />
      Let's understand this step by step in the simplest way possible.
    </p>

    <h2>1️⃣ IP Address: The Internet's House Number 🏠</h2>

    />
    <p>
      When we want to send data from one computer to another, we first need to
      know where to send it.<br />
      That's what an IP address does.<br />
      It's like a house number on the internet.<br />
      Every device (computer, phone, or server) has a unique IP address.<br />
      <br />
      So your data now knows the "house" it needs to reach.
    </p>

    <h2>2️⃣ MAC Address: The Exact Flat 🏢</h2>

      alt="mac-address"
      width="700px"
    />
    <p>
      Okay, we found the house. But inside a big building, there may be many
      flats. Which flat exactly?<br />
      That's where the MAC address comes in.<br />
      It's like the flat number inside the building.<br />
      It uniquely identifies a single device (your laptop, your phone, or even
      your Wi-Fi router).<br />
      <br />
      Now the data knows exactly which device should receive it.
    </p>

    <h2>3️⃣ Port Number: The Right Room 🚪</h2>
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*g0TsAMUZcSZg2oZDZ5y26w.png"
      alt="port number"
    />
    <p>
      Great! The data reached the device. But wait—your device runs many apps at
      once.<br />
      So how does the data know whether to go to your browser, email app, or
      WhatsApp?<br />
      That's where the port number helps.<br />
      Think of it like a room inside the flat.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Example:</strong><br />
      Port 80 → websites (HTTP)<br />
      Port 443 → secure websites (HTTPS)<br />
      <br />
      Now, the data is delivered to the right app.
    </p>

    <h2>4️⃣ DNS: Turning Names into Numbers 📖</h2>
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*V4d253uLgOf8St2leJg1vw.png"
      alt="DNS"
    />
    <p>
      We don't type IP addresses like 142.250.190.78. Instead, we type names
      like www.google.com.<br />
      But computers only understand numbers. So we need DNS (Domain Name
      System).<br />
      DNS works like a phonebook.<br />
      You give it the name (google.com), it returns the number (IP address).
    </p>

    <h2>5️⃣ ISP and Routers: Finding the Fastest Path 🚦</h2>
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*F7y3frfDNd-TO_cTVsWHBw.png"
      alt="isp"
    />
    <p>
      Alright, we have the IP address. But how do we travel there?<br />
      First, your request goes to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).<br />
      Then it passes through routers, which are like traffic signals that decide
      the fastest route to the destination server.
    </p>

    <h2>6️⃣ The Server: The Warehouse of Data 🏬</h2>
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*wbxRO_YoRyoVHm6W583_HA.png"
      alt="server"
    />
    <p>
      Now your request reaches the server.<br />
      Think of a server as a warehouse storing website data.<br />
      It finds the right files and sends them back to you.<br />
      <br />
      Usually, the server sends three main files:<br />
      <strong>HTML</strong> → the structure of the webpage<br />
      <strong>CSS</strong> → the design and look<br />
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> → the interactivity
    </p>

    <h2>7️⃣ Browser Rendering: The Final Picture 🖥️</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, your browser takes these files and assembles them—like putting
      Lego blocks together.<br />
      And boom! The webpage appears on your screen.
