    <h1>How DNS Works: The Journey From a Name to an IP Address 🗂️</h1>
    <p>
      When you type www.google.com in your browser, your computer doesn't
      actually understand "google.com." Computers talk in numbers called IP
      addresses - something like 222.4.5.6.<br />
      So how does the internet translate names into numbers? That's where DNS
      (Domain Name System) comes in. It works like a phonebook of the internet.
      Let's walk through the process with the diagram above.

    <h2>1️⃣ Check Local Cache 🗃️</h2>

      alt="local"
    />
    <p>
      When you enter www.google.com, your computer first looks in its cached DNS
      records.<br />
      If it has seen this website before, it may already know the IP (like
      222.4.5.6).<br />
      If it's not stored, your computer asks the ISP's DNS resolver.
    </p>

    <h2>2️⃣ ISP's DNS Resolver 🧑‍💻</h2>
    <p>
      The resolver at your Internet Service Provider (ISP) acts like a
      helper.<br />
      If the resolver has the IP cached, it returns it immediately.<br />
      If not, it must go on a search mission.
    </p>

    <h2>3️⃣ Root Name Servers 🌍</h2>

      alt="rootNameServer"
    />
    <p>
      The resolver first asks a Root Name Server.<br />
      There are 13 main root servers worldwide with fixed IP addresses.<br />
      The root server doesn't know the final answer, but it points the resolver
      in the right direction.<br /><br />
      For example, for www.google.com, the root says:<br />
      "Go check the <strong>.com</strong> TLD server."
    </p>

    <h2>4️⃣ TLD Servers (.com, .in, .ai) 🏷️</h2>
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*uEB_J6PgCdUDCbSKwCarIQ.png"
      alt="TLD"
    />
    <p>
      The resolver now queries the TLD (Top-Level Domain) server.<br />
      <strong>.com</strong> for commercial sites<br />
      <strong>.in</strong> for India<br />
      <strong>.ai</strong> for Anguilla (and now AI-related projects)<br /><br />
      The TLD server still doesn't give the IP. Instead, it points to the
      authoritative name server for that domain.
    </p>

    <h2>5️⃣ Authoritative Name Server 🗄️</h2>
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*jDeyTw_WyX3Y21ZfCHQJDQ.png"
      alt="nameServer"
    />
    <p>
      Finally, the resolver reaches the authoritative name server for
      google.com.<br />
      This server has the actual DNS record.<br />
      It returns the correct IP address, like 222.4.5.6.
    </p>

    <h2>6️⃣ Back to the Browser 🖥️</h2>
    <img
      src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*648Ph3fx_2j4H7h11avs9A.png"
      alt="browser"
    />
    <p>
      Now the ISP's resolver passes the IP back to your computer.<br />
      Your browser uses that IP to connect directly to the web server.<br />
      The server responds with the website data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and the
      page loads in your browser.
